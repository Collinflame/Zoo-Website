<h2>Details of Freshwater Habitat by National Geographic</h2>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/nature/habitats/article/freshwater">Rivers, creeks, lakes, ponds, and streams are all freshwater habitats. So are wetlands like swamps, which have woody plants and trees; and marshes,
    which have no trees but lots of grasses and reeds. Freshwater accounts for only three percent of the worldâ€™s water. (The rest is saltwater.)
    But despite that tiny amount, freshwater habitats are homes for more than 100,000 species of plants and animals.</blockquote>
