<h2>Details of Rainforest Habitat by National Geographic</h2>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/nature/habitats/article/rain-forest">Rainforests are lush, warm, wet habitats. Trees in the rainforest grow very tall because they have to compete with other plants for sunlight.
    Kapok trees, which are found in tropical rainforests around the world, can grow to 200 feet. The tallest trees spread their branches and leaves blocking the light from the trees below, and creating a canopy over the forest. When one of the big trees dies and falls,
    the opening lets in more sunlight so that a smaller tree can grow and take its place.</blockquote>
