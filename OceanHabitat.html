<h2>Details of Freshwater Habitat by National Geographic</h2>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/nature/habitats/article/ocean">Oceans are areas of salty water that fill enormous basins on the Earthâ€™s surface.
    Even though Earth has one continuous body of saltwater, scientists and geographers divide it into five different sections.
    From biggest to smallest, they are the Pacific, the Atlantic, the Indian, the Southern, and the Arctic Oceans.</blockquote>
